# Debt-Calculator
A personal debt calculator I made to easily keep track of my finances, across my credit card[s] and bank account. This was made from Pythonista on iOS, so it can easily be used with that application.

# Features I will consider adding in the future
 - Ability to quickly modify account balances (for situations where the user has not updated their purchases in a while)
 - Bill Checklist (so the user knows what's been paid, and what hasn't, for the month)
